//MIDDLEWARES SECTION
app.use(cors()); /* NOTE :CORS is a security mechanism implemented by browsers to restrict how resources on a web page can be requested from another domain. 
                    By default, browsers block requests made to a server from a different origin (protocol, domain, or port) than the one hosting the web page.
                    for example:
                    If your frontend is deployed one domain e.g., Render and my backend (Express server) is deployed on another domain - e.g. my college server, the browser will block requests made to your API unless CORS is enabled.

                             // hense: if two rights fits - needs to mannage it via middleware.
